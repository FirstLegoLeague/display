use it with the `css` module in the config like this:

        ...
        'css': {
            href: [
                'themes/rednblue-plus/rednblue-plus.css',
                // 'themes/rednblue-plus/rednblue-plus-mod-rtl.css',
                // 'themes/rednblue-plus/rednblue-plus-mod-opaque.css'
            ],
        },
        ...

The rtl modifier css can be added for rtl text support.

The opaque modifier can be added to make everything fully opaque instead of partially transparent. This can be useful when working with a chroma-key.
